# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  Hashes in Ruby hold unique key:value pairs. They help us organize AND create data. They are similar to arrays except that instead of their values being referenced by their index, they are referenced by their unique keys. - Vicente



2. What is a gem?

  Researched answer:
A "gem" is a software package that contains a Ruby app or library, used to change Ruby functionality when building applications. Gems contain code (including tests and supporting utilities), documentation, and gemspec. - Tameka


3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Ruby on Rails is an open-sourced web application framework that was written in the Ruby language. It uses Convention over Configuration, which means that ROR will suggest doing things in a specific way that ROR thinks will work best. It was designed to make designing web apps easier by making assumptions about what the dev needs to do, allows devs to write less code and makes it more fun - LJ


4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
A relational database stores data in tables and rows and makes the data relational by assigning each row of data a unique identifier (primary key). This key can be added to a record in another table where it is called the foreign key. This key connection allows data to be easily referenced between different tables and generally results in data accuracy and consistency. Non-relational databases stores data without the use of tables, rows, or keys. The method of data storage is typically optimatized for the requirements of the type of data being stored. - Jack


5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
In a database, a primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. Databases use keys to compare, sort and store records and to create relationships between records. Primary key are essential to databases because these keys are used to compare and otherwise define relationships between individual records. Never change the primary key after you assign it. - Neco
